This directory is concerned with generating the following frameworks for use
on OS X:

GMP.framework
GNUreadline.framework

To make them, run 'make all' in this directory.  (The first time that you
run that command, the readline source file readline-5.2.tar.gz will be 
downloaded from the bash site ftp.cwru.edu into this directory.)

Once you've built the frameworks, you should copy them into
/Library/Frameworks.  All subsequent builds of ghc will automatically use 
them as dependencies.
