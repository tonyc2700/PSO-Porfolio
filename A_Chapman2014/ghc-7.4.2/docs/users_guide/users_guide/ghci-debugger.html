      stop a running computation in order to examine the values of
      variables.  The debugger is integrated into GHCi, and is turned on by
      default: no flags are required to enable the debugging
      facilities.  There is one major restriction: breakpoints and
      single-stepping are only available in interpreted modules;
      compiled code is invisible to the debugger<sup>[<a name="idp20669960" href="#ftn.idp20669960" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup>.</p><p>The debugger provides the following:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The ability to set a <em class="firstterm">breakpoint</em> on a
            function definition or expression in the program.  When the function
            is called, or the expression evaluated, GHCi suspends
            execution and returns to the prompt, where you can inspect the
            values of local variables before continuing with the
            execution.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Execution can be <em class="firstterm">single-stepped</em>: the
            evaluator will suspend execution approximately after every
            reduction, allowing local variables to be inspected.  This is
            equivalent to setting a breakpoint at every point in the
            program.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Execution can take place in <em class="firstterm">tracing
              mode</em>, in which the evaluator remembers each
            evaluation step as it happens, but doesn't suspend execution until
            an actual breakpoint is reached.  When this happens, the history of
            evaluation steps can be inspected.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Exceptions (e.g. pattern matching failure and
            <code class="literal">error</code>) can be treated as breakpoints, to help
            locate the source of an exception in the program.</p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>There is currently no support for obtaining a &#8220;stack
    trace&#8221;, but the tracing and history features provide a
    useful second-best, which will often be enough to establish the
    context of an error.  For instance, it is possible to break
    automatically when an exception is thrown, even if it is thrown
    from within compiled code (see <a class="xref" href="ghci-debugger.html#ghci-debugger-exceptions" title="2.5.6. Debugging exceptions">Section 2.5.6, &#8220;Debugging exceptions&#8221;</a>).</p><div class="sect2" title="2.5.1. Breakpoints and inspecting variables"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="breakpoints"></a>2.5.1. Breakpoints and inspecting variables</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's use quicksort as a running example.  Here's the code:</p><pre class="programlisting">
qsort [] = []
qsort (a:as) = qsort left ++ [a] ++ qsort right
  where (left,right) = (filter (&lt;=a) as, filter (&gt;a) as)

main = print (qsort [8, 4, 0, 3, 1, 23, 11, 18])
</pre><p>First, load the module into GHCi:</p><pre class="screen">
Prelude&gt; :l qsort.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( qsort.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
*Main&gt;
      </pre><p>Now, let's set a breakpoint on the right-hand-side of the second
        equation of qsort:</p><pre class="programlisting">
*Main&gt; :break 2
Breakpoint 0 activated at qsort.hs:2:15-46
*Main&gt;
</pre><p>The command <code class="literal">:break 2</code> sets a breakpoint on line
        2 of the most recently-loaded module, in this case
        <code class="literal">qsort.hs</code>.   Specifically, it picks the
        leftmost complete subexpression on that line on which to set the
        breakpoint, which in this case is the expression
        <code class="literal">(qsort left ++ [a] ++ qsort right)</code>.</p><p>Now, we run the program:</p><pre class="programlisting">
*Main&gt; main
Stopped at qsort.hs:2:15-46
_result :: [a]
a :: a
left :: [a]
right :: [a]
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt;
</pre><p>Execution has stopped at the breakpoint.  The prompt has changed to
        indicate that we are currently stopped at a breakpoint, and the location:
        <code class="literal">[qsort.hs:2:15-46]</code>.  To further clarify the
        location, we can use the <code class="literal">:list</code> command:</p><pre class="programlisting">
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; :list
1  qsort [] = []
2  qsort (a:as) = qsort left ++ [a] ++ qsort right
3    where (left,right) = (filter (&lt;=a) as, filter (&gt;a) as)
</pre><p>The <code class="literal">:list</code> command lists the source code around
        the current breakpoint.  If your output device supports it, then GHCi
        will highlight the active subexpression in bold.</p><p>GHCi has provided bindings for the free variables<sup>[<a name="idp20683080" href="#ftn.idp20683080" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup> of the expression
        on which the
        breakpoint was placed (<code class="literal">a</code>, <code class="literal">left</code>,
        <code class="literal">right</code>), and additionally a binding for the result of
        the expression (<code class="literal">_result</code>).  These variables are just
        like other variables that you might define in GHCi; you
        can use them in expressions that you type at the prompt, you can ask
        for their types with <code class="literal">:type</code>, and so on.  There is one
        important difference though: these variables may only have partial
        types.  For example, if we try to display the value of
        <code class="literal">left</code>:</p><pre class="screen">
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; left

&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
      `Show a' arising from a use of `print' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-3
    Cannot resolve unknown runtime types: a
    Use :print or :force to determine these types
</pre><p>This is because <code class="literal">qsort</code> is a polymorphic function,
        and because GHCi does not carry type information at runtime, it cannot
        determine the runtime types of free variables that involve type
        variables.  Hence, when you ask to display <code class="literal">left</code> at
        the prompt, GHCi can't figure out which instance of
        <code class="literal">Show</code> to use, so it emits the type error above.</p><p>Fortunately, the debugger includes a generic printing command,
        <code class="literal">:print</code>, which can inspect the actual runtime value of a
        variable and attempt to reconstruct its type.  If we try it on
        <code class="literal">left</code>:</p><pre class="screen">
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; :set -fprint-evld-with-show
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; :print left
left = (_t1::[a])
</pre><p>This isn't particularly enlightening.  What happened is that
        <code class="literal">left</code> is bound to an unevaluated computation (a
        suspension, or <em class="firstterm">thunk</em>), and
        <code class="literal">:print</code> does not force any evaluation.  The idea is
        that <code class="literal">:print</code> can be used to inspect values at a
        breakpoint without any unfortunate side effects.  It won't force any
        evaluation, which could cause the program to give a different answer
        than it would normally, and hence it won't cause any exceptions to be
        raised, infinite loops, or further breakpoints to be triggered (see
        <a class="xref" href="ghci-debugger.html#nested-breakpoints" title="2.5.3. Nested breakpoints">Section 2.5.3, &#8220;Nested breakpoints&#8221;</a>).
        Rather than forcing thunks, <code class="literal">:print</code>
        binds each thunk to a fresh variable beginning with an
        underscore, in this case
        <code class="literal">_t1</code>.</p><p>The flag <code class="literal">-fprint-evld-with-show</code> instructs
      <code class="literal">:print</code> to reuse
      available <code class="literal">Show</code> instances when possible. This happens
      only when the contents of the variable being inspected
      are completely evaluated.</p><p>If we aren't concerned about preserving the evaluatedness of a
        variable, we can use <code class="literal">:force</code> instead of
        <code class="literal">:print</code>.  The <code class="literal">:force</code> command
        behaves exactly like <code class="literal">:print</code>, except that it forces
        the evaluation of any thunks it encounters:</p><pre class="screen">
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; :force left
left = [4,0,3,1]
</pre><p>Now, since <code class="literal">:force</code> has inspected the runtime
        value of <code class="literal">left</code>, it has reconstructed its type.  We
        can see the results of this type reconstruction:</p><pre class="screen">
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; :show bindings
_result :: [Integer]
a :: Integer
left :: [Integer]
right :: [Integer]
_t1 :: [Integer]
</pre><p>Not only do we now know the type of <code class="literal">left</code>, but
        all the other partial types have also been resolved.  So we can ask
        for the value of <code class="literal">a</code>, for example:</p><pre class="screen">
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; a
8
</pre><p>You might find it useful to use Haskell's
        <code class="literal">seq</code> function to evaluate individual thunks rather
        than evaluating the whole expression with <code class="literal">:force</code>.
        For example:</p><pre class="screen">
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; :print right
right = (_t1::[Integer])
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; seq _t1 ()
()
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; :print right
right = 23 : (_t2::[Integer])
</pre><p>We evaluated only the <code class="literal">_t1</code> thunk, revealing the
        head of the list, and the tail is another thunk now bound to
        <code class="literal">_t2</code>.  The <code class="literal">seq</code> function is a
        little inconvenient to use here, so you might want to use
        <code class="literal">:def</code> to make a nicer interface (left as an exercise
        for the reader!).</p><p>Finally, we can continue the current execution:</p><pre class="screen">
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; :continue
Stopped at qsort.hs:2:15-46
_result :: [a]
a :: a
left :: [a]
right :: [a]
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt;
</pre><p>The execution continued at the point it previously stopped, and has
        now stopped at the breakpoint for a second time.</p><div class="sect3" title="2.5.1.1. Setting breakpoints"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="setting-breakpoints"></a>2.5.1.1. Setting breakpoints</h4></div></div></div><p>Breakpoints can be set in various ways.  Perhaps the easiest way to
          set a breakpoint is to name a top-level function:</p><pre class="screen">
   :break <em class="replaceable"><code>identifier</code></em>
</pre><p>Where <em class="replaceable"><code>identifier</code></em> names any top-level
        function in an interpreted module currently loaded into GHCi (qualified
        names may be used).  The breakpoint will be set on the body of the
        function, when it is fully applied but before any pattern matching has
        taken place.</p><p>Breakpoints can also be set by line (and optionally column)
        number:</p><pre class="screen">
   :break <em class="replaceable"><code>line</code></em>
   :break <em class="replaceable"><code>line</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>column</code></em>
   :break <em class="replaceable"><code>module</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>line</code></em>
   :break <em class="replaceable"><code>module</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>line</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>column</code></em>
</pre><p>When a breakpoint is set on a particular line, GHCi sets the
        breakpoint on the
        leftmost subexpression that begins and ends on that line.  If two
        complete subexpressions start at the same
        column, the longest one is picked.  If there is no complete
        subexpression on the line, then the leftmost expression starting on
        the line is picked, and failing that the rightmost expression that
        partially or completely covers the line.</p><p>When a breakpoint is set on a particular line and column, GHCi
        picks the smallest subexpression that encloses that location on which
        to set the breakpoint.  Note: GHC considers the TAB character to have a
        width of 1, wherever it occurs; in other words it counts
          characters, rather than columns.  This matches what some editors do,
          and doesn't match others.  The best advice is to avoid tab
          characters in your source code altogether (see
          <code class="option">-fwarn-tabs</code> in <a class="xref" href="options-sanity.html" title="4.8. Warnings and sanity-checking">Section 4.8, &#8220;Warnings and sanity-checking&#8221;</a>).</p><p>If the module is omitted, then the most recently-loaded module is
        used.</p><p>Not all subexpressions are potential breakpoint locations.  Single
        variables are typically not considered to be breakpoint locations
        (unless the variable is the right-hand-side of a function definition,
        lambda, or case alternative).  The rule of thumb is that all redexes
        are breakpoint locations, together with the bodies of functions,
        lambdas, case alternatives and binding statements.  There is normally
        no breakpoint on a let expression, but there will always be a
        breakpoint on its body, because we are usually interested in inspecting
        the values of the variables bound by the let.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="2.5.1.2. Listing and deleting breakpoints"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp20712328"></a>2.5.1.2. Listing and deleting breakpoints</h4></div></div></div><p>The list of breakpoints currently enabled can be displayed using

        program, and it is also a useful tool for identifying the source of a
        bug. GHCi offers two variants of stepping. Use
	<code class="literal">:step</code>  to enable all the
        breakpoints in the program, and execute until the next breakpoint is
        reached. Use <code class="literal">:steplocal</code> to limit the set
	of enabled breakpoints to those in the current top level function.
	Similarly, use <code class="literal">:stepmodule</code> to single step only on
	breakpoints contained in the current module.
	For example:</p><pre class="screen">
*Main&gt; :step main
Stopped at qsort.hs:5:7-47
_result :: IO ()
</pre><p>The command <code class="literal">:step
        <em class="replaceable"><code>expr</code></em></code> begins the evaluation of
        <em class="replaceable"><code>expr</code></em> in single-stepping mode.  If
        <em class="replaceable"><code>expr</code></em> is omitted, then it single-steps from
        the current breakpoint. <code class="literal">:stepover</code>
        works similarly.</p><p>The <code class="literal">:list</code> command is particularly useful when
        single-stepping, to see where you currently are:</p><pre class="screen">
[qsort.hs:5:7-47] *Main&gt; :list
4
5  main = print (qsort [8, 4, 0, 3, 1, 23, 11, 18])
6
[qsort.hs:5:7-47] *Main&gt;
</pre><p>In fact, GHCi provides a way to run a command when a breakpoint is
        hit, so we can make it automatically do
        <code class="literal">:list</code>:</p><pre class="screen">
[qsort.hs:5:7-47] *Main&gt; :set stop :list
[qsort.hs:5:7-47] *Main&gt; :step
Stopped at qsort.hs:5:14-46
_result :: [Integer]

        the prompt triggers a
        second breakpoint, the new breakpoint becomes the &#8220;current&#8221;
      one, and the old one is saved on a stack.  An arbitrary number of
        breakpoint contexts can be built up in this way.  For example:</p><pre class="screen">
[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; :st qsort [1,3]
Stopped at qsort.hs:(1,0)-(3,55)
_result :: [a]
... [qsort.hs:(1,0)-(3,55)] *Main&gt;
</pre><p>While stopped at the breakpoint on line 2 that we set earlier, we
        started a new evaluation with <code class="literal">:step qsort [1,3]</code>.
        This new evaluation stopped after one step (at the definition of
        <code class="literal">qsort</code>).  The prompt has changed, now prefixed with
        <code class="literal">...</code>, to indicate that there are saved breakpoints
        beyond the current one.  To see the stack of contexts, use
        <code class="literal">:show context</code>:</p><pre class="screen">
... [qsort.hs:(1,0)-(3,55)] *Main&gt; :show context

  Stopped at qsort.hs:(1,0)-(3,55)

        <code class="literal">:abandon</code>:</p><pre class="screen">

[qsort.hs:2:15-46] *Main&gt; :abandon

        variable <code class="literal">_result</code> to the value of the currently
        active expression.  The value of <code class="literal">_result</code> is
        presumably not available yet, because we stopped its evaluation, but it
        can be forced: if the type is known and showable, then just entering
        <code class="literal">_result</code> at the prompt will show it.  However,
        there's one caveat to doing this: evaluating <code class="literal">_result</code>
        will be likely to trigger further breakpoints, starting with the
        breakpoint we are currently stopped at (if we stopped at a real
        breakpoint, rather than due to <code class="literal">:step</code>).  So it will
        probably be necessary to issue a <code class="literal">:continue</code>
        immediately when evaluating <code class="literal">_result</code>.  Alternatively,
        you can use <code class="literal">:force</code> which ignores breakpoints.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="2.5.5. Tracing and history"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tracing"></a>2.5.5. Tracing and history</h3></div></div></div><p>A question that we often want to ask when debugging a program is
        &#8220;how did I get here?&#8221;.  Traditional imperative debuggers
        usually provide some kind of stack-tracing feature that lets you see
        the stack of active function calls (sometimes called the &#8220;lexical
        call stack&#8221;), describing a path through the code
        to the current location.  Unfortunately this is hard to provide in
        Haskell, because execution proceeds on a demand-driven basis, rather
        than a depth-first basis as in strict languages.  The
        &#8220;stack&#8220; in GHC's execution engine bears little
        resemblance to the lexical call stack.  Ideally GHCi would maintain a
        separate lexical call stack in addition to the dynamic call stack, and
        in fact this is exactly
        what our profiling system does (<a class="xref" href="profiling.html" title="Chapter 5. Profiling">Chapter 5, <i>Profiling</i></a>), and what
        some other Haskell debuggers do.  For the time being, however, GHCi
        doesn't maintain a lexical call stack (there are some technical
        challenges to be overcome).  Instead, we provide a way to backtrack from a
        breakpoint to previous evaluation steps: essentially this is like
        single-stepping backwards, and should in many cases provide enough
        information to answer the &#8220;how did I get here?&#8221;
        question.</p><p>To use tracing, evaluate an expression with the
        <code class="literal">:trace</code> command.  For example, if we set a breakpoint
        on the base case of <code class="literal">qsort</code>:</p><pre class="screen">
*Main&gt; :list qsort
1  qsort [] = []
2  qsort (a:as) = qsort left ++ [a] ++ qsort right
3    where (left,right) = (filter (&lt;=a) as, filter (&gt;a) as)
4
*Main&gt; :b 1
Breakpoint 1 activated at qsort.hs:1:11-12
*Main&gt;
</pre><p>and then run a small <code class="literal">qsort</code> with
        tracing:</p><pre class="screen">

Stopped at qsort.hs:1:11-12
_result :: [a]
[qsort.hs:1:11-12] *Main&gt;
</pre><p>We can now inspect the history of evaluation steps:</p><pre class="screen">
[qsort.hs:1:11-12] *Main&gt; :hist

        &#8220;where did this exception come from?&#8221;.  Exceptions such as
        those raised by <code class="literal">error</code> or <code class="literal">head []</code>
        have no context information attached to them.  Finding which
        particular call to <code class="literal">head</code> in your program resulted in
        the error can be a painstaking process, usually involving
        <code class="literal">Debug.Trace.trace</code>, or compiling with
        profiling and using <code class="literal">Debug.Trace.traceStack</code>
        or <code class="literal">+RTS -xc</code> (see <a class="xref" href="prof-time-options.html" title="5.3. Time and allocation profiling">Section 5.3, &#8220;Time and allocation profiling&#8221;</a>).</p><p>The GHCi debugger offers a way to hopefully shed some light on
        these errors quickly and without modifying or recompiling the source
        code.  One way would be to set a breakpoint on the location in the
        source code that throws the exception, and then use
        <code class="literal">:trace</code> and <code class="literal">:history</code> to establish
        the context.  However, <code class="literal">head</code> is in a library and
        we can't set a breakpoint on it directly.  For this reason, GHCi
        provides the flags <code class="literal">-fbreak-on-exception</code> which causes
        the evaluator to stop when an exception is thrown, and <code class="literal">
	-fbreak-on-error</code>, which works similarly but stops only on
	uncaught exceptions. When stopping at an exception, GHCi will act
	just as it does when a breakpoint is hit, with the deviation that it
	will not show you any source code location. Due to this, these
	commands are only really useful in conjunction with
        <code class="literal">:trace</code>, in order to log the steps leading up to the
        exception.  For example:</p><pre class="screen">
*Main&gt; :set -fbreak-on-exception
*Main&gt; :trace qsort ("abc" ++ undefined)

</pre><p>The exception itself is bound to a new variable,

        Control-C, and examine the history to find out what was going

        It is possible to use the debugger to examine function values.
        When we are at a breakpoint and a function is in scope, the debugger
        cannot show
        you the source code for it; however, it is possible to get some
        information by applying it to some arguments and  observing the result.
      </p><p>
        The process is slightly complicated when the binding is polymorphic.
        We show the process by means of an example.
        To keep things simple, we will use the well known <code class="literal">map</code> function:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
import Prelude hiding (map)

map :: (a-&gt;b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map f [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        We set a breakpoint on <code class="literal">map</code>, and call it.
</p><pre class="screen">
*Main&gt; :break 5
Breakpoint 0 activated at  map.hs:5:15-28
*Main&gt; map Just [1..5]
Stopped at map.hs:(4,0)-(5,12)
_result :: [b]
x :: a
f :: a -&gt; b
xs :: [a]
</pre><p>
      GHCi tells us that, among other bindings, <code class="literal">f</code> is in scope.
      However, its type is not fully known yet,
      and thus it is not possible to apply it to any
      arguments. Nevertheless, observe that the type of its first argument is the
      same as the type of <code class="literal">x</code>, and its result type is shared
        with <code class="literal">_result</code>.
      </p><p>
        As we demonstrated earlier (<a class="xref" href="ghci-debugger.html#breakpoints" title="2.5.1. Breakpoints and inspecting variables">Section 2.5.1, &#8220;Breakpoints and inspecting variables&#8221;</a>),  the
        debugger has some intelligence built-in to update the type of
        <code class="literal">f</code> whenever the types of <code class="literal">x</code> or
        <code class="literal">_result</code> are discovered.  So what we do in this
        scenario is
        force <code class="literal">x</code> a bit, in order to recover both its type
      and the argument part of <code class="literal">f</code>.
</p><pre class="screen">
*Main&gt; seq x ()
*Main&gt; :print x
x = 1
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        We can check now that as expected, the type of <code class="literal">x</code>
        has been reconstructed, and with it the
        type of <code class="literal">f</code> has been too:</p><pre class="screen">
*Main&gt; :t x
x :: Integer
*Main&gt; :t f
f :: Integer -&gt; b
</pre><p>
        From here, we can apply f to any argument of type Integer and observe
        the results.
</p><pre class="screen">
*Main&gt; let b = f 10
*Main&gt; :t b
b :: b
*Main&gt; b
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    Ambiguous type variable `b' in the constraint:
      `Show b' arising from a use of `print' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0
*Main&gt; :p b
b = (_t2::a)
*Main&gt; seq b ()
()
*Main&gt; :t b
b :: a
*Main&gt; :p b
b = Just 10
*Main&gt; :t b
b :: Maybe Integer
*Main&gt; :t f
f :: Integer -&gt; Maybe Integer
*Main&gt; f 20
Just 20
*Main&gt; map f [1..5]
[Just 1, Just 2, Just 3, Just 4, Just 5]
</pre><p>
      In the first application of <code class="literal">f</code>, we had to do
      some more type reconstruction
      in order to recover the result type of <code class="literal">f</code>.
      But after that, we are free to use
      <code class="literal">f</code> normally.
