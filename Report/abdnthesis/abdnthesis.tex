%% For citations, I would recommend natbib for its
%% flexibility, particularly when named citation styles are used, but
%% it also has useful features for plain and those of that ilk.
%% The natbib package gives you the following definitons
%% that extend the simple \cite:
%   \citet{key} ==>>                Jones et al. (1990)
%   \citet*{key} ==>>               Jones, Baker, and Smith (1990)
%   \citep{key} ==>>                (Jones et al., 1990)
%   \citep*{key} ==>>               (Jones, Baker, and Smith, 1990)
%   \citep[chap. 2]{key} ==>>       (Jones et al., 1990, chap. 2)
%   \citep[e.g.][]{key} ==>>        (e.g. Jones et al., 1990)
%   \citep[e.g.][p. 32]{key} ==>>   (e.g. Jones et al., p. 32)
%   \citeauthor{key} ==>>           Jones et al.
%   \citeauthor*{key} ==>>          Jones, Baker, and Smith

%% It is useful to split the document up as chapters and include
%% them.  LaTeX will sort out all the numbering and cross-referencing
%% for you --- if you run it enough times!

%% If you want to include only a couple of chapters then use the
%% \includeonly{} command with a list of the file/chapter names that
%% you wish to include.  NB, this must be in the preamble.

% \includeonly{introduction,faq,chap1}

%% This will make sure that all cross-references are correct (including
%% references to those file not included) but will produce a dvi
%% file with only those files/chapters you specify included.
