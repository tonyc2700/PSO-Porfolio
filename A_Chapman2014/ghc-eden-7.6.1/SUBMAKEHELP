  make

     Builds everything in this directory (including dependencies elsewhere
     in the tree, if necessary)

  make fast

     The same as 'make', but omits some phases and does not
     recalculate dependencies.  Useful for saving time if you are sure
     the rest of the tree is up to date.

  make clean
  make distclean
  make maintainer-clean

     Clean just this directory

  make html
  make pdf
  make ps
     
     Make documentation in this directory (if any)

  make show VALUE=var

     Show the value of $(var)

  make <file>

     Bring a particular file up to date, e.g. make dist/build/Module.o
     The name <file> is relative to the current directory
