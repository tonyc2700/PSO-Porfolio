            This only affects heap profiling; time profiles are always

      like <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">why is this data being retained?</span>&#8221;</span>.  We start
      by defining what we mean by a retainer:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A retainer is either the system stack, or an unevaluated
	closure (thunk).</p></blockquote></div><p>In particular, constructors are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      retainers.</p><p>An object B retains object A if (i) B is a retainer object and
     (ii) object A can be reached by recursively following pointers
     starting from object B, but not meeting any other retainer
     objects on the way. Each live object is retained by one or more
     retainer objects, collectively called its retainer set, or its
      <em class="firstterm">retainer set</em>, or its
      <em class="firstterm">retainers</em>.</p><p>When retainer profiling is requested by giving the program
      the <code class="option">-hr</code> option, a graph is generated which is
      broken down by retainer set.  A retainer set is displayed as a
      set of cost-centre stacks; because this is usually too large to
      fit on the profile graph, each retainer set is numbered and
      shown abbreviated on the graph along with its number, and the
      full list of retainer sets is dumped into the file
      <code class="filename"><em class="replaceable"><code>prog</code></em>.prof</code>.</p><p>Retainer profiling requires multiple passes over the live
      heap in order to discover the full retainer set for each
      object, which can be quite slow.  So we set a limit on the
      maximum size of a retainer set, where all retainer sets larger
      than the maximum retainer set size are replaced by the special
      set <code class="literal">MANY</code>.  The maximum set size defaults to 8
      and can be altered with the <code class="option">-R</code> RTS
      option:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-R</code><em class="replaceable"><code>size</code></em></span></dt><dd><p>Restrict the number of elements in a retainer set to
	    <em class="replaceable"><code>size</code></em> (default 8).</p></dd></dl></div><div class="sect3" title="5.4.2.1. Hints for using retainer profiling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp27776784"></a>5.4.2.1. Hints for using retainer profiling</h4></div></div></div><p>The definition of retainers is designed to reflect a
        common cause of space leaks: a large structure is retained by
        an unevaluated computation, and will be released once the
        computation is forced.  A good example is looking up a value in
        a finite map, where unless the lookup is forced in a timely
        manner the unevaluated lookup will cause the whole mapping to
        be retained.  These kind of space leaks can often be
        eliminated by forcing the relevant computations to be
        performed eagerly, using <code class="literal">seq</code> or strictness
        annotations on data constructor fields.</p><p>Often a particular data structure is being retained by a
        chain of unevaluated closures, only the nearest of which will
        be reported by retainer profiling - for example A retains B, B
        retains C, and C retains a large structure.  There might be a
        large number of Bs but only a single A, so A is really the one
        we're interested in eliminating.  However, retainer profiling
        will in this case report B as the retainer of the large
        structure.  To move further up the chain of retainers, we can
        ask for another retainer profile but this time restrict the
        profile to B objects, so we get a profile of the retainers of
        B:</p><pre class="screen">
<em class="replaceable"><code>prog</code></em> +RTS -hr -hcB
</pre><p>This trick isn't foolproof, because there might be other
        B closures in the heap which aren't the retainers we are
        interested in, but we've found this to be a useful technique
        in most cases.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="5.4.3. Biographical Profiling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="biography-prof"></a>5.4.3. Biographical Profiling</h3></div></div></div><p>A typical heap object may be in one of the following four
      states at each point in its lifetime:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The <em class="firstterm">lag</em> stage, which is the
	  time between creation and the first use of the
	  object,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the <em class="firstterm">use</em> stage, which lasts from
	  the first use until the last use of the object, and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <em class="firstterm">drag</em> stage, which lasts
	  from the final use until the last reference to the object
	  is dropped.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An object which is never used is said to be in the
	  <em class="firstterm">void</em> state for its whole
	  lifetime.</p></li></ul></div><p>A biographical heap profile displays the portion of the
      live heap in each of the four states listed above.  Usually the
      most interesting states are the void and drag states: live heap
      in these states is more likely to be wasted space than heap in
      the lag or use states.</p><p>It is also possible to break down the heap in one or more
      of these states by a different criteria, by restricting a
      profile by biography.  For example, to show the portion of the
      heap in the drag or void state by producer: </p><pre class="screen">
<em class="replaceable"><code>prog</code></em> +RTS -hc -hbdrag,void
</pre><p>Once you know the producer or the type of the heap in the
      drag or void states, the next step is usually to find the
      retainer(s):</p><pre class="screen">
<em class="replaceable"><code>prog</code></em> +RTS -hr -hc<em class="replaceable"><code>cc</code></em>...
</pre><p>NOTE: this two stage process is required because GHC
      cannot currently profile using both biographical and retainer
      information simultaneously.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="5.4.4. Actual memory residency"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="mem-residency"></a>5.4.4. Actual memory residency</h3></div></div></div><p>How does the heap residency reported by the heap profiler relate to
	the actual memory residency of your program when you run it?  You might
	see a large discrepancy between the residency reported by the heap
	profiler, and the residency reported by tools on your system
	(eg. <code class="literal">ps</code> or <code class="literal">top</code> on Unix, or the
	Task Manager on Windows).  There are several reasons for this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>There is an overhead of profiling itself, which is subtracted
	    from the residency figures by the profiler.  This overhead goes
	    away when compiling without profiling support, of course.  The
	    space overhead is currently 2 extra
	    words per heap object, which probably results in
	    about a 30% overhead.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Garbage collection requires more memory than the actual
	    residency.  The factor depends on the kind of garbage collection
	    algorithm in use:  a major GC in the standard
	    generation copying collector will usually require 3L bytes of
	    memory, where L is the amount of live data.  This is because by
	    default (see the <code class="option">+RTS -F</code> option) we allow the old
	    generation to grow to twice its size (2L) before collecting it, and
	    we require additionally L bytes to copy the live data into.  When
	    using compacting collection (see the <code class="option">+RTS -c</code>
	    option), this is reduced to 2L, and can further be reduced by
	    tweaking the <code class="option">-F</code> option.  Also add the size of the
	    allocation area (currently a fixed 512Kb).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The stack isn't counted in the heap profile by default.  See the
    <code class="option">+RTS -xt</code> option.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The program text itself, the C stack, any non-heap data (eg. data
	    allocated by foreign libraries, and data allocated by the RTS), and
