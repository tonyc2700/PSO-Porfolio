      which uses <code class="literal">foreign export</code> or
      <code class="literal">foreign import "wrapper"</code>, it generates two
      additional files, <code class="filename">M_stub.c</code> and
      <code class="filename">M_stub.h</code>.  GHC will automatically compile
      <code class="filename">M_stub.c</code> to generate
      <code class="filename">M_stub.o</code> at the same time.</p><p>For a plain <code class="literal">foreign export</code>, the file
      <code class="filename">M_stub.h</code> contains a C prototype for the
      foreign exported function, and <code class="filename">M_stub.c</code>
      contains its definition.  For example, if we compile the
      following module:</p><pre class="programlisting">
module Foo where

foreign export ccall foo :: Int -&gt; IO Int

foo :: Int -&gt; IO Int
foo n = return (length (f n))

f :: Int -&gt; [Int]
f 0 = []
f n = n:(f (n-1))</pre><p>Then <code class="filename">Foo_stub.h</code> will contain
      something like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">
#include "HsFFI.h"
extern HsInt foo(HsInt a0);</pre><p>and <code class="filename">Foo_stub.c</code> contains the
      compiler-generated definition of <code class="literal">foo()</code>.  To
      invoke <code class="literal">foo()</code> from C, just <code class="literal">#include
      "Foo_stub.h"</code> and call <code class="literal">foo()</code>.</p><p>The <code class="filename">foo_stub.c</code> and
	<code class="filename">foo_stub.h</code> files can be redirected using the
	<code class="option">-stubdir</code> option; see <a class="xref" href="separate-compilation.html#options-output" title="4.7.4. Redirecting the compilation output(s)">Section 4.7.4, &#8220;Redirecting the compilation output(s)&#8221;</a>.</p><p>When linking the program, remember to include
        <code class="filename">M_stub.o</code> in the final link command line, or
        you'll get link errors for the missing function(s) (this isn't
        necessary when building your program with <code class="literal">ghc
        &#8211;&#8211;make</code>, as GHC will automatically link in the
        correct bits).</p><div class="sect3" title="8.2.1.1. Using your own main()"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="using-own-main"></a>8.2.1.1. Using your own <code class="literal">main()</code></h4></div></div></div><p>Normally, GHC's runtime system provides a
	<code class="literal">main()</code>, which arranges to invoke
	<code class="literal">Main.main</code> in the Haskell program.  However,
	you might want to link some Haskell code into a program which
	has a main function written in another language, say C.  In
	order to do this, you have to initialize the Haskell runtime
	system explicitly.</p><p>Let's take the example from above, and invoke it from a
	standalone C program.  Here's the C code:</p><pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "HsFFI.h"

#ifdef __GLASGOW_HASKELL__
#include "foo_stub.h"
#endif

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int i;

  hs_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", foo(2500));
  }

  hs_exit();
  return 0;
}</pre><p>We've surrounded the GHC-specific bits with
	<code class="literal">#ifdef __GLASGOW_HASKELL__</code>; the rest of the
	code should be portable across Haskell implementations that
	support the FFI standard.</p><p>The call to <code class="literal">hs_init()</code>
	initializes GHC's runtime system.  Do NOT try to invoke any
	Haskell functions before calling
	<code class="literal">hs_init()</code>: bad things will
	undoubtedly happen.</p><p>We pass references to <code class="literal">argc</code> and
	<code class="literal">argv</code> to <code class="literal">hs_init()</code>
	so that it can separate out any arguments for the RTS
	(i.e. those arguments between
	<code class="literal">+RTS...-RTS</code>).</p><p>After we've finished invoking our Haskell functions, we
	can call <code class="literal">hs_exit()</code>, which terminates the
	RTS.</p><p>There can be multiple calls to
	<code class="literal">hs_init()</code>, but each one should be matched
	by one (and only one) call to
	<code class="literal">hs_exit()</code><sup>[<a name="idp33065960" href="#ftn.idp33065960" class="footnote">14</a>]</sup>.</p><p>NOTE: when linking the final program, it is normally
	easiest to do the link using GHC, although this isn't
	essential.  If you do use GHC, then don't forget the flag
	<code class="option">-no-hs-main</code><a class="indexterm" name="idp33067760"></a>, otherwise GHC will try to link
	to the <code class="literal">Main</code> Haskell module.</p><p>To use <code class="literal">+RTS</code> flags
          with <code class="literal">hs_init()</code>, we have to modify the
          example slightly.  By default, GHC's RTS will only accept
          "safe"
          <code class="literal">+RTS</code> flags (see
          <a class="xref" href="options-phases.html#options-linker" title="4.12.6. Options affecting linking">Section 4.12.6, &#8220;Options affecting linking&#8221;</a>), and
          the <code class="option">-rtsopts</code><a class="indexterm" name="idp33070656"></a> link-time flag overrides this.
          However, <code class="option">-rtsopts</code> has no effect
          when <code class="option">-no-hs-main</code> is in use (and the same
          goes for <code class="option">-with-rtsopts</code>).  To set these
          options we have to call a GHC-specific API instead
          of <code class="option">hs_init()</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "HsFFI.h"

#include "foo_stub.h"
#include "Rts.h"

{
  int i;

#if __GLASGOW_HASKELL__ &gt;= 703

      hs_init_ghc(&amp;argc, &amp;argv, conf);
  }

  hs_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
#endif

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", foo(2500));
  }

  hs_exit();
  return 0;
}</pre><p>Note two changes: we included <code class="literal">Rts.h</code>,
        which defines the GHC-specific external RTS interface, and we
        called <code class="literal">hs_init_ghc()</code> instead
        of <code class="literal">hs_init()</code>, passing an argument of
        type <code class="literal">RtsConfig</code>.
        <code class="literal">RtsConfig</code> is a struct with various fields
        that affect the behaviour of the runtime system.  Its
        definition is:</p><pre class="programlisting">
typedef struct {
    RtsOptsEnabledEnum rts_opts_enabled;
    const char *rts_opts;
} RtsConfig;

extern const RtsConfig defaultRtsConfig;

typedef enum {
    RtsOptsNone,         // +RTS causes an error
    RtsOptsSafeOnly,     // safe RTS options allowed; others cause an error
    RtsOptsAll           // all RTS options allowed
  } RtsOptsEnabledEnum;
</pre><p>There is a default
        value <code class="literal">defaultRtsConfig</code> that should be used
        to initialise variables of type <code class="literal">RtsConfig</code>.
        More fields will undoubtedly be added
        to <code class="literal">RtsConfig</code> in the future, so in order to
        keep your code forwards-compatible it is best to initialise
        with <code class="literal">defaultRtsConfig</code> and then modify the
        required fields, as in the code sample above.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="8.2.1.2. Making a Haskell library that can be called from foreign code"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="ffi-library"></a>8.2.1.2. Making a Haskell library that can be called from foreign

          make a library from Haskell code that can be deployed in the same
          way that you would deploy a library of C code.</p><p>The main requirement here is that the runtime needs to be
          initialized before any Haskell code can be called, so your library
          should provide initialisation and deinitialisation entry points,
          implemented in C or C++.  For example:</p><pre class="programlisting">
 HsBool mylib_init(void){
   int argc = ...
   char *argv[] = ...

   // Initialize Haskell runtime
   hs_init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

   // do any other initialization here and
   // return false if there was a problem
   return HS_BOOL_TRUE;
 }

 void mylib_end(void){
   hs_exit();
 }
</pre><p>The initialisation routine, <code class="literal">mylib_init</code>, calls
          <code class="literal">hs_init()</code> as
          normal to initialise the Haskell runtime, and the corresponding
          deinitialisation function <code class="literal">mylib_end()</code> calls
          <code class="literal">hs_exit()</code> to shut down the runtime.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="8.2.2. Using header files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="glasgow-foreign-headers"></a>8.2.2. Using header files</h3></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="idp33083736"></a><p>C functions are normally declared using prototypes in a C
        header file.  Earlier versions of GHC (6.8.3 and

        compiler could therefore check that the C function being

        compiling via C, so this checking is not performed.  The

        (<code class="literal">-fasm</code>) and to comply strictly with the FFI
        specification, which requires that FFI calls are not subject
        to macro expansion and other CPP conversions that may be
        applied when using C header files.  This approach also
        simplifies the inlining of foreign calls across module and
        package boundaries: there's no need for the header file to be
        available when compiling an inlined version of a foreign call,
        so the compiler is free to inline foreign calls in any
        context.</p><p>The <code class="literal">-#include</code> option is now

      for use with the FFI, and it isn't always clear which way is the
      best.  This decision may be affected by how efficient a
      particular kind of allocation is on a given compiler/platform,
      so this section aims to shed some light on how the different
      kinds of allocation perform with GHC.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">alloca</code> and friends</span></dt><dd><p>Useful for short-term allocation when the allocation

	    using <code class="literal">MutableByteArray#</code>, so allocation
	    and deallocation are fast: much faster than C's
	    <code class="literal">malloc/free</code>, but not quite as fast as

	    <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a good choice, however.</p><p>In GHC, <code class="literal">mallocForeignPtr</code> is also
	    implemented using <code class="literal">MutableByteArray#</code>.
	    Although the memory is pointed to by a
	    <code class="literal">ForeignPtr</code>, there are no actual
	    finalizers involved (unless you add one with
	    <code class="literal">addForeignPtrFinalizer</code>), and the
	    deallocation is done using GC, so
	    <code class="literal">mallocForeignPtr</code> is normally very
	    cheap.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">malloc/free</code></span></dt><dd><p>If all else fails, then you need to resort to
	    <code class="literal">Foreign.malloc</code> and
	    <code class="literal">Foreign.free</code>.  These are just wrappers
	    around the C functions of the same name, and their
	    efficiency will depend ultimately on the implementations
	    of these functions in your platform's C library.  We
	    usually find <code class="literal">malloc</code> and

        (see <a class="xref" href="options-phases.html#options-linker" title="4.12.6. Options affecting linking">Section 4.12.6, &#8220;Options affecting linking&#8221;</a>).</p><div class="sect3" title="8.2.4.1. Foreign imports and multi-threading"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp33102272"></a>8.2.4.1. Foreign imports and multi-threading</h4></div></div></div><p>When you call a <code class="literal">foreign import</code>ed
          function that is annotated as <code class="literal">safe</code> (the
          default), and the program was linked
          using <code class="option">-threaded</code>, then the call will run
          concurrently with other running Haskell threads.  If the
          program was linked without <code class="option">-threaded</code>,
          then the other Haskell threads will be blocked until the
          call returns.</p><p>This means that if you need to make a foreign call to
          a function that takes a long time or blocks indefinitely,
          then you should mark it <code class="literal">safe</code> and
          use <code class="option">-threaded</code>.  Some library functions
          make such calls internally; their documentation should
          indicate when this is the case.</p><p>If you are making foreign calls from multiple Haskell
          threads and using <code class="option">-threaded</code>, make sure that
          the foreign code you are calling is thread-safe.  In
          particularly, some GUI libraries are not thread-safe and
          require that the caller only invokes GUI methods from a
          single thread.  If this is the case, you may need to
          restrict your GUI operations to a single Haskell thread,
          and possibly also use a bound thread (see
          <a class="xref" href="ffi-ghc.html#haskell-threads-and-os-threads" title="8.2.4.2. The relationship between Haskell threads and OS threads">Section 8.2.4.2, &#8220;The relationship between Haskell threads and OS
          threads&#8221;</a>).</p><p>Note that foreign calls made by different Haskell
          threads may execute in <span class="emphasis"><em>parallel</em></span>, even
          when the <code class="literal">+RTS -N</code> flag is not being used

          -N</code> flag controls parallel execution of Haskell
          threads, but there may be an arbitrary number of foreign
          calls in progress at any one time, regardless of
          the <code class="literal">+RTS -N</code> value.</p><p>If a call is annotated as <code class="literal">interruptible</code>
          and the program was multithreaded, the call may be
          interrupted in the event that the Haskell thread receives an
          exception.  The mechanism by which the interrupt occurs
          is platform dependent, but is intended to cause blocking
          system calls to return immediately with an interrupted error
          code.  The underlying operating system thread is not to be
          destroyed.  See <a class="xref" href="ffi.html#ffi-interruptible" title="8.1.4. Interruptible foreign calls">Section 8.1.4, &#8220;Interruptible foreign calls&#8221;</a> for more details.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="8.2.4.2. The relationship between Haskell threads and OS threads"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="haskell-threads-and-os-threads"></a>8.2.4.2. The relationship between Haskell threads and OS
          threads</h4></div></div></div><p>Normally there is no fixed relationship between Haskell
          threads and OS threads.  This means that when you make a
          foreign call, that call may take place in an unspecified OS
          thread.  Furthermore, there is no guarantee that multiple
          calls made by one Haskell thread will be made by the same OS
          thread.</p><p>This usually isn't a problem, and it allows the GHC
          runtime system to make efficient use of OS thread resources.
          However, there are cases where it is useful to have more
          control over which OS thread is used, for example when
          calling foreign code that makes use of thread-local state.
          For cases like this, we provide <span class="emphasis"><em>bound
          threads</em></span>, which are Haskell threads tied to a
          particular OS thread.  For information on bound threads, see

          be initialised as usual by

          any running Haskell threads in the system, and when
          <code class="literal">hs_exit()</code> returns, there will be no more Haskell
          threads running.  The runtime will then shut down the system in an
          orderly way, generating profiling
          output and statistics if necessary, and freeing all the memory it
          owns.</p><p>It isn't always possible to terminate a Haskell thread forcibly:
          for example, the thread might be currently executing a foreign call,
          and we have no way to force the foreign call to complete.  What's
          more, the runtime must
          assume that in the worst case the Haskell code and runtime are about
          to be removed from memory (e.g. if this is a <a class="link" href="win32-dlls.html" title="12.6. Building and using Win32 DLLs">Windows DLL</a>,
          <code class="literal">hs_exit()</code> is normally called before unloading the
          DLL).  So <code class="literal">hs_exit()</code> <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> wait
          until all outstanding foreign calls return before it can return
          itself.</p><p>The upshot of this is that if you have Haskell threads that are
          blocked in foreign calls, then <code class="literal">hs_exit()</code> may hang
          (or possibly busy-wait) until the calls return.  Therefore it's a
          good idea to make sure you don't have any such threads in the system
          when calling <code class="literal">hs_exit()</code>.  This includes any threads
          doing I/O, because I/O may (or may not, depending on the
          type of I/O and the platform) be implemented using blocking foreign
          calls.</p><p>The GHC runtime treats program exit as a special case, to avoid
          the need to wait for blocked threads when a standalone
          executable exits.  Since the program and all its threads are about to
          terminate at the same time that the code is removed from memory, it
          isn't necessary to ensure that the threads have exited first.
          (Unofficially, if you want to use this fast and loose version of
          <code class="literal">hs_exit()</code>, then call
          <code class="literal">shutdownHaskellAndExit()</code> instead).</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="8.2.5. Floating point and the FFI"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ffi-floating-point"></a>8.2.5. Floating point and the FFI</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The standard C99 <code class="literal">fenv.h</code> header
        provides operations for inspecting and modifying the state of
        the floating point unit.  In particular, the rounding mode
        used by floating point operations can be changed, and the
        exception flags can be tested.
      </p><p>
        In Haskell, floating-point operations have pure types, and the
        evaluation order is unspecified.  So strictly speaking, since
        the <code class="literal">fenv.h</code> functions let you change the
        results of, or observe the effects of floating point
        operations, use of <code class="literal">fenv.h</code> renders the
        behaviour of floating-point operations anywhere in the program
        undefined.
      </p><p>
        Having said that, we <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> document exactly
        what GHC does with respect to the floating point state, so
        that if you really need to use <code class="literal">fenv.h</code> then
        you can do so with full knowledge of the pitfalls:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
              GHC completely ignores the floating-point
              environment, the runtime neither modifies nor reads it.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              The floating-point environment is not saved over a
              normal thread context-switch.  So if you modify the
              floating-point state in one thread, those changes may be
              visible in other threads.  Furthermore, testing the
              exception state is not reliable, because a context
              switch may change it.  If you need to modify or test the
              floating point state and use threads, then you must use
              bound threads
              (<code class="literal">Control.Concurrent.forkOS</code>), because
              a bound thread has its own OS thread, and OS threads do
              save and restore the floating-point state.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              It is safe to modify the floating-point unit state
              temporarily during a foreign call, because foreign calls
              are never pre-empted by GHC.
