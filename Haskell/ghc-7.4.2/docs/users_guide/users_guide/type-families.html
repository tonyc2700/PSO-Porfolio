  13th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
  Programming&#8221;, ACM Press, pages 51-62, 2008. Type families
  essentially provide type-indexed data types and named functions on types,
  which are useful for generic programming and highly parameterised library
  interfaces as well as interfaces with enhanced static information, much like
  dependent types. They might also be regarded as an alternative to functional
  dependencies, but provide a more functional style of type-level programming
  than the relational style of functional dependencies.
</p><p>
  Indexed type families, or type families for short, are type constructors that
  represent sets of types. Set members are denoted by supplying the type family
  constructor with type parameters, which are called <em class="firstterm">type
  indices</em>. The
  difference between vanilla parametrised type constructors and family
  constructors is much like between parametrically polymorphic functions and
  (ad-hoc polymorphic) methods of type classes. Parametric polymorphic functions
  behave the same at all type instances, whereas class methods can change their
  behaviour in dependence on the class type parameters. Similarly, vanilla type
  constructors imply the same data representation for all type instances, but
  family constructors can have varying representation types for varying type
  indices.
</p><p>
  Indexed type families come in two flavours: <em class="firstterm">data
    families</em> and <em class="firstterm">type synonym
    families</em>. They are the indexed family variants of algebraic
  data types and type synonyms, respectively. The instances of data families
  can be data types and newtypes.
</p><p>
  Type families are enabled by the flag <code class="option">-XTypeFamilies</code>.
  Additional information on the use of type families in GHC is available on
  <a class="ulink" href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Indexed_types" target="_top">the
  Haskell wiki page on type families</a>.

    Data families appear in two flavours: (1) they can be defined on the
    toplevel
    or (2) they can appear inside type classes (in which case they are known as
    associated types). The former is the more general variant, as it lacks the
    requirement for the type-indexes to coincide with the class
    parameters. However, the latter can lead to more clearly structured code and
    compiler warnings if some type instances were - possibly accidentally -
    omitted. In the following, we always discuss the general toplevel form first
    and then cover the additional constraints placed on associated types.
  </p><div class="sect3" title="7.7.1.1. Data family declarations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="data-family-declarations"></a>7.7.1.1. Data family declarations</h4></div></div></div><p>
      Indexed data families are introduced by a signature, such as
</p><pre class="programlisting">
data family GMap k :: * -&gt; *
</pre><p>
      The special <code class="literal">family</code> distinguishes family from standard
      data declarations.  The result kind annotation is optional and, as
      usual, defaults to <code class="literal">*</code> if omitted.  An example is
</p><pre class="programlisting">
data family Array e
</pre><p>
      Named arguments can also be given explicit kind signatures if needed.
      Just as with
      [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/gadt.html GADT
      declarations] named arguments are entirely optional, so that we can
      declare <code class="literal">Array</code> alternatively with
</p><pre class="programlisting">
data family Array :: * -&gt; *
</pre><p>
    </p></div><div class="sect3" title="7.7.1.2. Data instance declarations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="data-instance-declarations"></a>7.7.1.2. Data instance declarations</h4></div></div></div><p>
      Instance declarations of data and newtype families are very similar to
      standard data and newtype declarations.  The only two differences are
      that the keyword <code class="literal">data</code> or <code class="literal">newtype</code>
      is followed by <code class="literal">instance</code> and that some or all of the
      type arguments can be non-variable types, but may not contain forall
      types or type synonym families.  However, data families are generally
      allowed in type parameters, and type synonyms are allowed as long as
      they are fully applied and expand to a type that is itself admissible -
      exactly as this is required for occurrences of type synonyms in class
      instance parameters.  For example, the <code class="literal">Either</code>
      instance for <code class="literal">GMap</code> is
</p><pre class="programlisting">
data instance GMap (Either a b) v = GMapEither (GMap a v) (GMap b v)
</pre><p>
      In this example, the declaration has only one variant.  In general, it
      can be any number.
    </p><p>
      Data and newtype instance declarations are only permitted when an
      appropriate family declaration is in scope - just as a class instance declaration
      requires the class declaration to be visible.  Moreover, each instance
      declaration has to conform to the kind determined by its family
      declaration.  This implies that the number of parameters of an instance
      declaration matches the arity determined by the kind of the family.
    </p><p>
      A data family instance declaration can use the full expressiveness of
      ordinary <code class="literal">data</code> or <code class="literal">newtype</code> declarations:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p> Although, a data family is <span class="emphasis"><em>introduced</em></span> with
      the keyword "<code class="literal">data</code>", a data family <span class="emphasis"><em>instance</em></span> can
      use either <code class="literal">data</code> or <code class="literal">newtype</code>. For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
data family T a
data    instance T Int  = T1 Int | T2 Bool
newtype instance T Char = TC Bool
</pre><p>
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p> A <code class="literal">data instance</code> can use GADT syntax for the data constructors,
      and indeed can define a GADT.  For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
data family G a b
data instance G [a] b where
   G1 :: c -&gt; G [Int] b
   G2 :: G [a] Bool
</pre><p>
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p> You can use a <code class="literal">deriving</code> clause on a
      <code class="literal">data instance</code> or <code class="literal">newtype instance</code>
      declaration.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      Even if type families are defined as toplevel declarations, functions
      that perform different computations for different family instances may still
      need to be defined as methods of type classes.  In particular, the
      following is not possible:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
data family T a
data instance T Int  = A
data instance T Char = B
foo :: T a -&gt; Int
foo A = 1             -- WRONG: These two equations together...
foo B = 2             -- ...will produce a type error.
</pre><p>
Instead, you would have to write <code class="literal">foo</code> as a class operation, thus:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
class Foo a where
  foo :: T a -&gt; Int
instance Foo Int where
  foo A = 1
instance Foo Char where
  foo B = 2
</pre><p>
      (Given the functionality provided by GADTs (Generalised Algebraic Data
      Types), it might seem as if a definition, such as the above, should be
      feasible.  However, type families are - in contrast to GADTs - are
      <span class="emphasis"><em>open;</em></span> i.e., new instances can always be added,
      possibly in other
      modules.  Supporting pattern matching across different data instances
      would require a form of extensible case construct.)
    </p></div><div class="sect3" title="7.7.1.3. Overlap of data instances"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="data-family-overlap"></a>7.7.1.3. Overlap of data instances</h4></div></div></div><p>
	The instance declarations of a data family used in a single program
	may not overlap at all, independent of whether they are associated or
	not.  In contrast to type class instances, this is not only a matter
	of consistency, but one of type safety.

    Type families appear in two flavours: (1) they can be defined on the
    toplevel or (2) they can appear inside type classes (in which case they
    are known as associated type synonyms).  The former is the more general
    variant, as it lacks the requirement for the type-indexes to coincide with
    the class parameters.  However, the latter can lead to more clearly
    structured code and compiler warnings if some type instances were -
    possibly accidentally - omitted.  In the following, we always discuss the
    general toplevel form first and then cover the additional constraints
    placed on associated types.
  </p><div class="sect3" title="7.7.2.1. Type family declarations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="type-family-declarations"></a>7.7.2.1. Type family declarations</h4></div></div></div><p>
      Indexed type families are introduced by a signature, such as
</p><pre class="programlisting">
type family Elem c :: *
</pre><p>
      The special <code class="literal">family</code> distinguishes family from standard
      type declarations.  The result kind annotation is optional and, as
      usual, defaults to <code class="literal">*</code> if omitted.  An example is
</p><pre class="programlisting">
type family Elem c
</pre><p>
      Parameters can also be given explicit kind signatures if needed.  We
      call the number of parameters in a type family declaration, the family's
      arity, and all applications of a type family must be fully saturated
      w.r.t. to that arity.  This requirement is unlike ordinary type synonyms
      and it implies that the kind of a type family is not sufficient to
      determine a family's arity, and hence in general, also insufficient to
      determine whether a type family application is well formed.  As an
      example, consider the following declaration:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
type family F a b :: * -&gt; *   -- F's arity is 2,
                              -- although its overall kind is * -&gt; * -&gt; * -&gt; *
</pre><p>
      Given this declaration the following are examples of well-formed and
      malformed types:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
F Char [Int]       -- OK!  Kind: * -&gt; *
F Char [Int] Bool  -- OK!  Kind: *
F IO Bool          -- WRONG: kind mismatch in the first argument
F Bool             -- WRONG: unsaturated application
</pre><p>
      </p></div><div class="sect3" title="7.7.2.2. Type instance declarations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="type-instance-declarations"></a>7.7.2.2. Type instance declarations</h4></div></div></div><p>
      Instance declarations of type families are very similar to standard type
      synonym declarations.  The only two differences are that the
      keyword <code class="literal">type</code> is followed
      by <code class="literal">instance</code> and that some or all of the type
      arguments can be non-variable types, but may not contain forall types or
      type synonym families. However, data families are generally allowed, and
      type synonyms are allowed as long as they are fully applied and expand
      to a type that is admissible - these are the exact same requirements as
      for data instances.  For example, the <code class="literal">[e]</code> instance
      for <code class="literal">Elem</code> is
</p><pre class="programlisting">
type instance Elem [e] = e
</pre><p>
    </p><p>
      Type family instance declarations are only legitimate when an
      appropriate family declaration is in scope - just like class instances
      require the class declaration to be visible.  Moreover, each instance
      declaration has to conform to the kind determined by its family
      declaration, and the number of type parameters in an instance
      declaration must match the number of type parameters in the family
      declaration.   Finally, the right-hand side of a type instance must be a
      monotype (i.e., it may not include foralls) and after the expansion of
      all saturated vanilla type synonyms, no synonyms, except family synonyms
      may remain.  Here are some examples of admissible and illegal type
      instances:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
type family F a :: *
type instance F [Int]              = Int         -- OK!
type instance F String             = Char        -- OK!
type instance F (F a)              = a           -- WRONG: type parameter mentions a type family
type instance F (forall a. (a, b)) = b           -- WRONG: a forall type appears in a type parameter
type instance F Float              = forall a.a  -- WRONG: right-hand side may not be a forall type

type family G a b :: * -&gt; *
type instance G Int            = (,)     -- WRONG: must be two type parameters
type instance G Int Char Float = Double  -- WRONG: must be two type parameters
</pre><p>
    </p></div><div class="sect3" title="7.7.2.3. Overlap of type synonym instances"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="type-family-overlap"></a>7.7.2.3. Overlap of type synonym instances</h4></div></div></div><p>
	The instance declarations of a type family used in a single program
	may only overlap if the right-hand sides of the overlapping instances
	coincide for the overlapping types.  More formally, two instance
	declarations overlap if there is a substitution that makes the
	left-hand sides of the instances syntactically the same.  Whenever
	that is the case, the right-hand sides of the instances must also be
	syntactically equal under the same substitution.  This condition is
	independent of whether the type family is associated or not, and it is
	not only a matter of consistency, but one of type safety.
      </p><p>
	Here are two example to illustrate the condition under which overlap
	is permitted.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
type instance F (a, Int) = [a]
type instance F (Int, b) = [b]   -- overlap permitted

type instance G (a, Int)  = [a]
type instance G (Char, a) = [a]  -- ILLEGAL overlap, as [Char] /= [Int]

	In order to guarantee that type inference in the presence of type
	families decidable, we need to place a number of additional
	restrictions on the formation of type instance declarations (c.f.,
	Definition 5 (Relaxed Conditions) of &#8220;<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/SPCS08.html" target="_top">Type
	  Checking with Open Type Functions</a>&#8221;).  Instance
	  declarations have the general form
</p><pre class="programlisting">
type instance F t1 .. tn = t
</pre><p>
        where we require that for every type family application <code class="literal">(G s1
        .. sm)</code> in <code class="literal">t</code>,
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">s1 .. sm</code> do not contain any type family
	    constructors,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the total number of symbols (data type constructors and type
	    variables) in <code class="literal">s1 .. sm</code> is strictly smaller than
	    in <code class="literal">t1 .. tn</code>, and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>for every type
	    variable <code class="literal">a</code>, <code class="literal">a</code> occurs
	    in <code class="literal">s1 .. sm</code> at most as often as in <code class="literal">t1
	    .. tn</code>.</p></li></ol></div><p>
	These restrictions are easily verified and ensure termination of type
	inference.  However, they are not sufficient to guarantee completeness
	of type inference in the presence of, so called, ''loopy equalities'',
	such as <code class="literal">a ~ [F a]</code>, where a recursive occurrence of
	a type variable is underneath a family application and data
	constructor application - see the above mentioned paper for details.
      </p><p>
	If the option <code class="option">-XUndecidableInstances</code> is passed to the
	compiler, the above restrictions are not enforced and it is on the
	programmer to ensure termination of the normalisation of type families
	during type inference.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="7.7.3. Associated data and type families"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="assoc-decl"></a>7.7.3. Associated data and type families</h3></div></div></div><p>
A data or type synonym family can be declared as part of a type class, thus:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
class GMapKey k where
  data GMap k :: * -&gt; *
  ...

class Collects ce where
  type Elem ce :: *
  ...
</pre><p>
When doing so, we drop the "<code class="literal">family</code>" keyword.
</p><p>
	The type parameters must all be type variables, of course,
        and some (but not necessarily all) of then can be the class
        parameters. Each class parameter may
	only be used at most once per associated type, but some may be omitted
	and they may be in an order other than in the class head.  Hence, the
	following contrived example is admissible:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
  class C a b c where
    type T c a x :: *
</pre><p>
        Here <code class="literal">c</code> and <code class="literal">a</code> are class parameters,
        but the type is also indexed on a third parameter <code class="literal">x</code>.
      </p><div class="sect3" title="7.7.3.1. Associated instances"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="assoc-data-inst"></a>7.7.3.1. Associated instances</h4></div></div></div><p>
	When an associated data or type synonym family instance is declared within a type
	class instance, we drop the <code class="literal">instance</code> keyword in the
	family instance:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
instance (GMapKey a, GMapKey b) =&gt; GMapKey (Either a b) where
  data GMap (Either a b) v = GMapEither (GMap a v) (GMap b v)
  ...

instance (Eq (Elem [e])) =&gt; Collects ([e]) where
  type Elem [e] = e
  ...
</pre><p>
        The most important point about associated family instances is that the
        type indexes corresponding to class parameters must be identical to
        the type given in the instance head; here this is the first argument
        of <code class="literal">GMap</code>, namely <code class="literal">Either a b</code>,
        which coincides with the only class parameter.
      </p><p>
	Instances for an associated family can only appear as part of
	instance declarations of the class in which the family was declared -
	just as with the equations of the methods of a class.  Also in
	correspondence to how methods are handled, declarations of associated
	types can be omitted in class instances.  If an associated family
	instance is omitted, the corresponding instance type is not inhabited;
	i.e., only diverging expressions, such
	as <code class="literal">undefined</code>, can assume the type.
      </p><p>
        Although it is unusual, there can be <span class="emphasis"><em>multiple</em></span>
        instances for an associated family in a single instance declaration.
        For example, this is legitimate:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
instance GMapKey Flob where
  data GMap Flob [v] = G1 v
  data GMap Flob Int = G2 Int
  ...
</pre><p>
        Here we give two data instance declarations, one in which the last
        parameter is <code class="literal">[v]</code>, and one for which it is <code class="literal">Int</code>.
        Since you cannot give any <span class="emphasis"><em>subsequent</em></span> instances for
        <code class="literal">(GMap Flob ...)</code>, this facility is most useful when
        the free indexed parameter is of a kind with a finite number of alternatives
        (unlike <code class="literal">*</code>).
      </p></div><div class="sect3" title="7.7.3.2. Associated type synonym defaults"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="assoc-decl-defs"></a>7.7.3.2. Associated type synonym defaults</h4></div></div></div><p>
        It is possible for the class defining the associated type to specify a
        default for associated type instances. So for example, this is OK:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
class IsBoolMap v where
  type Key v
  type Key v = Int

  lookupKey :: Key v -&gt; v -&gt; Maybe Bool

instance IsBoolMap [(Int, Bool)] where
  lookupKey = lookup
</pre><p>

There can also be multiple defaults for a single type, as long as they do not
overlap:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
class C a where
  type F a b
  type F a Int  = Bool
  type F a Bool = Int
</pre><p>

A default declaration is not permitted for an associated
<span class="emphasis"><em>data</em></span> type.
      </p></div><div class="sect3" title="7.7.3.3. Scoping of class parameters"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="scoping-class-params"></a>7.7.3.3. Scoping of class parameters</h4></div></div></div><p>
	The visibility of class
	parameters in the right-hand side of associated family instances
	depends <span class="emphasis"><em>solely</em></span> on the parameters of the
	family.  As an example, consider the simple class declaration
</p><pre class="programlisting">
class C a b where
  data T a
</pre><p>
        Only one of the two class parameters is a parameter to the data
        family.  Hence, the following instance declaration is invalid:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
instance C [c] d where
  data T [c] = MkT (c, d)    -- WRONG!!  'd' is not in scope
</pre><p>
        Here, the right-hand side of the data instance mentions the type
        variable <code class="literal">d</code> that does not occur in its left-hand
        side.  We cannot admit such data instances as they would compromise
        type safety.

   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/modules.html#sect5.2" target="_top">Section 5.2</a>)
needs adjustment for type families:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
  The form <code class="literal">T(..)</code>, where <code class="literal">T</code>
  is a data family, names the family <code class="literal">T</code> and all the in-scope
  constructors (whether in scope qualified or unqualified) that are data
  instances of <code class="literal">T</code>.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  The form <code class="literal">T(.., ci, .., fj, ..)</code>, where <code class="literal">T</code> is
  a data family, names <code class="literal">T</code> and the specified constructors <code class="literal">ci</code>
  and fields <code class="literal">fj</code> as usual. The constructors and field names must
  belong to some data instance of <code class="literal">T</code>, but are not required to belong
  to the <span class="emphasis"><em>same</em></span> instance.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  The form <code class="literal">C(..)</code>, where <code class="literal">C</code>
  is a class, names the class <code class="literal">C</code> and all its methods
  <span class="emphasis"><em>and associated types</em></span>.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  The form <code class="literal">C(.., mi, .., type Tj, ..)</code>, where <code class="literal">C</code> is a class,
  names the class <code class="literal">C</code>, and the specified methods <code class="literal">mi</code>
  and associated types <code class="literal">Tj</code>. The types need a keyword "<code class="literal">type</code>"
  to distinguish them from data constructors.
  </p></li></ul></div><p>

	Recall our running <code class="literal">GMapKey</code> class example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
class GMapKey k where
  data GMap k :: * -&gt; *
  insert :: GMap k v -&gt; k -&gt; v -&gt; GMap k v
  lookup :: GMap k v -&gt; k -&gt; Maybe v
  empty  :: GMap k v

instance (GMapKey a, GMapKey b) =&gt; GMapKey (Either a b) where
  data GMap (Either a b) v = GMapEither (GMap a v) (GMap b v)
  ...method declarations...
</pre><p>
Here are some export lists and their meaning:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">module GMap( GMapKey )</code>: Exports
	      just the class name.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">module GMap( GMapKey(..) )</code>:
	      Exports the class, the associated type <code class="literal">GMap</code>
	      and the member
	      functions <code class="literal">empty</code>, <code class="literal">lookup</code>,
	      and <code class="literal">insert</code>.  The data constructors of <code class="literal">GMap</code>
              (in this case <code class="literal">GMapEither</code>) are not exported.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">module GMap( GMapKey( type GMap, empty, lookup, insert ) )</code>:
              Same as the previous item. Note the "<code class="literal">type</code>" keyword.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">module GMap( GMapKey(..), GMap(..) )</code>:
              Same as previous item, but also exports all the data
	      constructors for <code class="literal">GMap</code>, namely <code class="literal">GMapEither</code>.
	      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">module GMap ( GMapKey( empty, lookup, insert), GMap(..) )</code>:
              Same as previous item.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">module GMap ( GMapKey, empty, lookup, insert, GMap(..) )</code>:
              Same as previous item.</p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
Two things to watch out for:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
        You cannot write <code class="literal">GMapKey(type GMap(..))</code> &#8212; i.e.,
	sub-component specifications cannot be nested.  To
	specify <code class="literal">GMap</code>'s data constructors, you have to list
	it separately.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
  Consider this example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
  module X where
    data family D

  module Y where
    import X
    data instance D Int = D1 | D2
</pre><p>
    Module Y exports all the entities defined in Y, namely the data constructors <code class="literal">D1</code>
    and <code class="literal">D2</code>, <span class="emphasis"><em>but not the data family <code class="literal">D</code></em></span>.
    That (annoyingly) means that you cannot selectively import Y selectively,
    thus "<code class="literal">import Y( D(D1,D2) )</code>", because Y does not export <code class="literal">D</code>.
    Instead you should list the exports explicitly, thus:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
     module Y( D(..) ) where ...
or   module Y( module Y, D ) where ...
</pre><p>
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></div><div class="sect3" title="7.7.4.2. Instances"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="data-family-impexp-instances"></a>7.7.4.2. Instances</h4></div></div></div><p>
	Family instances are implicitly exported, just like class instances.
	However, this applies only to the heads of instances, not to the data
	constructors an instance defines.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="7.7.5. Type families and instance declarations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ty-fams-in-instances"></a>7.7.5. Type families and instance declarations</h3></div></div></div><p>Type families require us to extend the rules for
      the form of instance heads, which are given
      in <a class="xref" href="type-class-extensions.html#flexible-instance-head" title="7.6.3.1. Relaxed rules for the instance head">Section 7.6.3.1, &#8220;Relaxed rules for the instance head&#8221;</a>.
      Specifically:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Data type families may appear in an instance head</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Type synonym families may not appear (at all) in an instance head</p></li></ul></div><p>
The reason for the latter restriction is that there is no way to check for instance
matching. Consider
</p><pre class="programlisting">
   type family F a
   type instance F Bool = Int

   class C a

   instance C Int
   instance C (F a)
</pre><p>
Now a constraint <code class="literal">(C (F Bool))</code> would match both instances.
The situation is especially bad because the type instance for <code class="literal">F Bool</code>
might be in another module, or even in a module that is not yet written.
</p><p>
However, type class instances of instances of data families can be defined
much like any other data type. For example, we can say
</p><pre class="programlisting">
data instance T Int = T1 Int | T2 Bool
instance Eq (T Int) where
  (T1 i) == (T1 j) = i==j
  (T2 i) == (T2 j) = i==j
  _      == _      = False
</pre><p>
	Note that class instances are always for
	particular <span class="emphasis"><em>instances</em></span> of a data family and never
	for an entire family as a whole.  This is for essentially the same
	reasons that we cannot define a toplevel function that performs
	pattern matching on the data constructors
	of <span class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> instances of a single type family.
	It would require a form of extensible case construct.
      </p><p>
Data instance declarations can also
	have <code class="literal">deriving</code> clauses.  For example, we can write
</p><pre class="programlisting">
data GMap () v = GMapUnit (Maybe v)
               deriving Show
</pre><p>
        which implicitly defines an instance of the form
</p><pre class="programlisting">
instance Show v =&gt; Show (GMap () v) where ...
</pre><p>
      </p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="type-class-extensions.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ghc-language-features.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="kind-polymorphism-and-promotion.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">7.6. Class and instances declarations </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 7.8. Kind polymorphism and promotion</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
