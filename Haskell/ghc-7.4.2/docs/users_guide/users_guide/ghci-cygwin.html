unix-style API on top of the windows libraries, to facilitate ports of
unix software to windows. To this end, they introduce a unix-style
directory hierarchy under some root directory (typically
<code class="filename">/</code> is <code class="filename">C:\cygwin\</code>). Moreover,
everything built against the cygwin API (including the cygwin tools
and programs compiled with cygwin's ghc) will see / as the root of
their file system, happily pretending to work in a typical unix
environment, and finding things like <code class="filename">/bin</code> and <code class="filename">/usr/include</code> without
ever explicitly bothering with their actual location on the windows
system (probably <code class="filename">C:\cygwin\bin</code> and <code class="filename">C:\cygwin\usr\include</code>).

windows program. It is built using mingw, and it uses mingw's ghc
while compiling your Haskell sources (even if you call it from
cygwin's bash), but what matters here is that - just like any other
normal windows program - neither GHC nor the executables it produces
are aware of cygwin's pretended unix hierarchy. GHC will happily
accept either '/' or '\' as path separators, but it won't know where
to find <code class="filename">/home/joe/Main.hs</code> or <code class="filename">/bin/bash</code>
or the like. This causes all
kinds of fun when GHC is used from within cygwin's bash, or in
make-sessions running under cygwin.

  that those might be passed to GHC (or to GHC-compiled programs). Relative
  paths are fine because cygwin tools are happy with them and GHC accepts
  '/' as path-separator. And relative paths don't depend on where cygwin's
  root directory is located, or on which partition or network drive your source
  tree happens to reside, as long as you 'cd' there first.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p> If you have to use absolute paths (beware of the innocent-looking
  <code class="literal">ROOT=`pwd`</code> in makefile hierarchies or configure scripts), cygwin provides
  a tool called <span class="command"><strong>cygpath</strong></span> that can convert cygwin's unix-style paths to their
  actual windows-style counterparts. Many cygwin tools actually accept
  absolute windows-style paths (remember, though, that you either need
  to escape '\' or convert '\' to '/'), so you should be fine just using those
  everywhere. If you need to use tools that do some kind of path-mangling
  that depends on unix-style paths (one fun example is trying to interpret ':'
  as a separator in path lists..), you can still try to convert paths using
  <span class="command"><strong>cygpath</strong></span> just before they are passed to GHC and friends.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p> If you don't have <span class="command"><strong>cygpath</strong></span>, you probably don't have cygwin and hence
  no problems with it... unless you want to write one build process for several
  platforms. Again, relative paths are your friend, but if you have to use
  absolute paths, and don't want to use different tools on different platforms,
  you can simply write a short Haskell program to print the current directory
   (thanks to George Russell for this idea): compiled with GHC, this will give
  you the view of the file system that GHC depends on (which will differ
  depending on whether GHC is compiled with cygwin's gcc or mingw's
  gcc or on a real unix system..) - that little program can also deal with
  escaping '\' in paths. Apart from the banner and the startup time,
  something like this would also do:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
  $ echo "Directory.getCurrentDirectory &gt;&gt;= putStrLn . init . tail . show " | ghci
</pre><p>
